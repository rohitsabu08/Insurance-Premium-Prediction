# Insurance-Premium-Prediction  

Goal:
Sample implementation of the Streamlit API implemented using a machine learning model.  Test the API locally with Streamlit and Deploy and test using a heroku and streamlit and later finally deploy to AWS EC2  Service.

Dataset :
The insurance.csv dataset contains 1338 observations (rows) and 7 features (columns). The dataset contains 4 numerical features (age, bmi, children and expenses) and 3 nominal features (sex, smoker and region) that were converted into factors with numerical value designated for each level.

Insurance.csv file is obtained from the Machine Learning course website (Spring 2017) from Professor Eric Suess at http://www.sci.csueastbay.edu/~esuess/stat6620/#week-6.

The purposes of this exercise to look into different features to observe their relationship, and plot a multiple linear regression based on several features of individual such as age, smoking,obesity,gender,family condition etc against their existing medical expense to be used for predicting future medical expenses of individuals that help medical insurance to make decision on charging the premium.
